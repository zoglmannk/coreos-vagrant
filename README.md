Random internet user. Do not use this. It is my personal playground. :)

## Docker Forwarding

By setting the `$expose_docker_tcp` configuration value you can forward a local TCP port to docker on
each CoreOS machine that you launch. The first machine will be available on the port that you specify
and each additional machine will increment the port by 1.

Follow the [Enable Remote API instructions][coreos-enabling-port-forwarding] to get the CoreOS VM setup to work with port forwarding.

Then you can then use the `docker` command from your local shell by setting `DOCKER_HOST`:

    export DOCKER_HOST=tcp://localhost:2375
